# Abstract:
The Fourier Series is a mathematical tool used to express periodic functions as a sum of sine and cosine functions. This project delves into its applications across multiple domains, including signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning. Key topics include image compression through high-pass filtering, noise reduction techniques, and the role of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, the project discusses the efficiency of FFT-based convolution layers compared to standard convolutions in deep learning. By leveraging Fourier techniques, this work highlights their importance in modern computational applications such as music note detection, image overlay systems, and data compression.
